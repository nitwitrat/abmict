          <p> • Game Engine: Ren'Py - Ren'Py is a visual novel game engine that uses Python as their main programming language to help game developers program a visual novel game.</p>
          <br>  
          <p>• Artists to Commission: @Floatzxs_ (Jericha Danielle Valles) -  a freelance artist currently studying at CIIT (College of Arts and Technology) that will help create game assets (art).</p>
          <br>  
          <p>• Music Producer: Vianca Santiago - a freelance music producer in charge of the OST and sound design</p>
          <br>  
          <p>• Offgamers Website - This'll be the website where our players can buy virtual coins for in game purchases.</p>
          <br>  
          <p>• Streamers - these are the people that we will be working with to help promote the game and introduce the game to our target audiences.</p>
          <br>  
          <p>• Online platforms for product Advertising - Alongside streamers, various social media platforms will be another way we promote the game, be it through twitter, instagram, youtube, facebook or twitch.</p>
          <br>  
          <p>• Capital Generation - To start our company and the game, we must first ensure a capital. Since most of us don't have that much money yet, we will enlist help from fundraisers like Kickstarter. We will also grab a business loan—in which our company has decided to partner with BPI for the matter. </p>
          <br>  
          <p>• IATF and Lipa LGU - Players will learn facts about Covid within the game. We envision that the Virus is like a boss within the game and the only way to beat it is by using the information and protocols they acquire in their playthrough. The information and protocols will be obtained from our interview with the IATF and Lipa LGU through online consultations. We will ask for their guidance and some of their research about the Virus to ensure that we will input accurate information only, within the game.</p>

          <p>The group intends to work with those who have influence and popularity on Social Media such as Youtubers and Twitch streamers that cater to Gaming content. Moreover, we also plan on collaborating with Social Media platforms themselves such as Youtube, Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook for Promotion and Marketing purposes. Additionally, the group will use Ren'Py, a visual novel engine that will serve as essential when it comes to the production of the game. We will also be working with artists and music producers such as Floatzxs_ (a freelance artist currently studying at CIIT) and Vianca Santiago (a student/music producer) respectively in order to help complete the game. Lastly, we will have bank loans from BDO and use Kickstarter to procure funds to further support this CAPSTONE project.</p>
